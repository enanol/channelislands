    <h1>Santa Cruz Island</h1>
    <p id="intro">Santa Cruz is one of the five islands that make up the Channel Islands National Park. I've only learned about the park earlier this year and had to see at least one myself. So, to Santa Cruz I went--on the 4th of July (2019).</p>

    <main>
    <p id="boatride">The only way to visit the island, unless one has a boat, is booking through <a href="https://www.islandpackers.com">Island Packers</a>.</p>
     <p>The company has been transporting people since 1968. Besides to/fro transportation, Island Packers also offers wildlife tours around the islands daily. That being said, early reservation is pertinent. I booked the trip to Santa Cruz a few days before the 4th and morning rides were already sold out. The earliest departure I could find was 11AM--arriving in Santa Cruz around 12:30PM. The last boat to leave the island is 4:30PM, but that was also sold out. I had to book the 4PM, which gave me about 3 hours to explore. This was ok. This wasn't going to be my last trip to the island anyway.</p>
    <p>Day trippers and overnighters/campers braved the hour boat ride in the choppy Pacific Ocean. We encountered young sea lions chilling on a red buoy and massive ships journeying through the Separation Zone. The Separation Zone is like a freeway for vessels. It is a regulated area where ships have to stay in their lane to prevent collisions especially in highly trafficked waters. It was particularly interesting to see the Disney Cruise Ship towering over the Hyundai cargo ship nearby. The cruise ship truly looked like a skyscraper hovering on top of the ocean!</p>

    <h2>Scorpion Anchorage</h2>
    <p>After an hour on the ocean, we passed by the smallest island, Anacapa. The island looked bare but with lots of birds hovering around it. We knew we were about to encounter "wild" California. Beyond the horizon was Santa Cruz, the biggest island. We docked in Scorpion Anchorage, located in the eastern part of Santa Cruz. The water below the dock was crystal clear! We can clearly see the luscious kelp forests as they swayed with the waves.</p>
      <p>Day trippers disembarked first; grouped together; and were given a brief orientation by a park ranger. While the orientation was going on, Scorpion shore had kayakers getting ready to explore the series of caves in the eastern part of the island. There were a few blankets on the bay of onlookers and there was a family of four getting ready to snorkel. It was a sight unlike any in California. Well, maybe except for Catalina.</p>

    <p>The ranger accompanied us to the historic ranch area where a couple of houses are still standing. Santa Cruz went through series of sheep and  cattle ranches from 1869 to ~1984.</p>

    <p>The National Park Services (NPS) acquired 25% of the island from the Gherini family. <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/california/stories-in-california/santa-cruz-island-anniversary/">The Nature Conservancy</a> purchased the remaining 75% in 1978 and eliminated the remaining cattle industry.</p>
    <p>In 2005, both the Nature Conservancy and NPS embarked on a controversial action to eradicate feral pigs. NPS already had its share of protesters four years prior when it eradicated black rats from Anacapa. The black rats were believed to have arrived on the island as stowaways on ships before 1940 and, since then, proved to be invasive species that threatened birds and Anacapa's deer mouse population. The process of eradication was air dropping poisonous green pellets which killed the rats over a  ~three days. This moved sparked protests from animal rights activists and debate on the very notion of "native" species. But process went through and Anacapa was restored to its "original state."</p>
    <p>The next step was the eradication of feral pigs on Santa Cruz. The pigs had been there since the 185s. Starting with less than 100 pigs, the population grew to about <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-jul-28-me-bones28-story.html">LA Times</a> 4,000 in 2005. Like the rats, the pigs threatened the lives of native species, e.g. the island foxes, and Chumash archaeological sites. "After 150 years, officials claim, there is an urgent need to eradicate pigs, because they are said to trample island vegetation and dig up Chumash Indian grave sites." (<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/green/article/Pig-eradication-plan-out-of-control-2668922.php">SFGATE</a>). The means to this end was to hunt/shoot the pigs. This action also faced heavy criticisms from animal rights activists, but the courts sided with the conservators. The operation took two years. Since then, Santa Cruz has been freed from non-native specied. And as a result of these measures, we now have the privilege of stepping into wild California; as if untouched by humans.</p>
    <h2>Island Fox</h2>
    <p>I vowed to see at least one island fox on this trip. Endemic island foxes are found in three of the 5 islands in the Channel Islands National Park. Scientifically referred to as <em>urocyon littoralis</em>, variations of the subspecies are endemic in each islan due to their prolonged isolationi from mainland gray foxes. One notable of these unique features is their size. Island foxes are miniatures compared to mainland foxes. They grow up to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/nature/island-fox.htm">12-13 inches tall and only weigh 4-5 lbs</a>. These foxes are not found anywhere else in the world.

      <li>Urocyon littoralis dickeyi of San Nicolas Island</li>
      <li>Urocyon littoralis catalinae of Santa Catalina Island</li>
      <li>Urocyon littoralis clementae of San Clemente Island</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Upon reaching the ranch area, I didn't have to look far. Other day trippers who were having their lunch at the tables next to the ranch house were pointing at the rustling of low-lying foliage. We looked down and there were two island foxes playing. They were not shy or afraid of people. They would even come closer to you if you have food!</p>

  <h2>Potato Harbor Overlook</h2>
  <p>Due to time constraints, I was only able to do one hike. There are several hiking trails on Santa Cruz, ranging from easy to hard. I chose an easy trail with an incredible vista at the end. The Potato Harbor Trail is a 5-mile loop with 603 feet elevation (<a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/potato-harbor-trail">All Trails</a>). There were no shady areas. Good thing, I had a hat! On the way to Potato Harbor is another trail leading to Cavern Point Loop.</p>

  <p>There were at least five other people on the trail so it wasn't too lonely of a hike. When we all finally got there, three people were already standing at the edge of the cliff, taking in the view. And really, who can blame them when the view is this..</p>

  <h3>Tips</h3>
  Santa Cruz Island offers an amazing experience to everyone. But because of its isolation and history, visitors have to be mindful of the following:
  <ol id="list">
    <li>Make sure you are not bringing any animals to the island, conciously or unconsciously. Clean your shoes and other belongings before disembarking.</li>
    <li>Remember that island foxes are still wild even when though they look friendly.</li>
    <li>There is no food for sale on the island so bring enough for the day.</li>
    <li>Potable water is only available at the Scorpion Ranch area.</li>
    <li>There is no electricity, so charge all your gadgets before going.</li>
    <li>There is absolutely no cellphone signal or WiFi.</li>
    <li>Do not get injured! 911 is going to take a while to get to the island.</li>
    <li>What comes with you, goes with you. All trash must be taken back to the mainland.</li>
    <li>Daytrippers, don't miss the last boat or you will be sleeping among the stars.</li>
  </ol>
