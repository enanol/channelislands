    <h1>The Channel Islands National Park -- Santa Cruz Island</h1>
    <main>
    <p id="intro">On the 4th of July (2019), I ventured out to Santa Cruz Island. Santa Cruz is one of the five islands that make up the Channel Islands National Park.
    <p id="boatride">The only way to visit the island, unless one has a boat, is booking through <a href="https://www.islandpackers.com">Island Packers</a>.
      <ul id="list">
        <li>Oxnard to East Anacapa: 1-1.5 hrs (year round)</li>
        <li>Ventura to Prisoners Harbor: 1-1.5 hrs (year round)</li>
        <li>Ventura to Scorpion Anchorage: 1-1.5 hrs (year round)</li>
        <li>Ventura to San Miguel: 4-5 hrs (May thru October)</li>
        <li>Ventura to Santa Rosa: 2-2.5 hrs (March thru November)</li>
      </ul>
    The company has been in charge of transporting people to the islands since 1968. There offer several boat rides to the islands and tours around the island daily. Although early reservation is pertinent. I booked the trip to Santa Cruz just a few days before the 4th and morning rides were already gone. The first trip to Santa Cruz is as early as 8AM. The last boat to leave the island is at 4:30PM. I had no choice but to do the 12pm and leave the island at 4; 4:30PM is the most popular departure time. This gave me around 3 hours to roam around. It was enough time to do some hiking, but definitely warranted future return trips.</p>
    <p>Along with other travelersâ€”some day trippers; some overnighters, I braved the hour boat ride in the choppy Pacific Ocean. We encountered a red buoy sheltering young sea lions and massive ships as they made their journeys on the Separation Zone, aka freeway of the ships. It was particularly interesting to see the Disney Cruise Ship towering over the Hyundai cargo ship nearby. The cruise ship truly looked like a skyscraper hovering on top of the ocean!</p>

    <h2>Scorpion Anchorage</h2>
    <p>After an hour on the ocean, we saw part of <em>Anacapa</em>. Beyond the horizon is Scorpion Anchorage, located in the eastern part of Santa Cruz. Our boat docked. Day trippers were disembarked first, grouped together, and were given a brief orientation from a park ranger. Looking down from the harbor, we could see luscious kelp forests swaying as small caves came into the bay. There were kayakers getting ready for their adventures into the series of caves that wrapped around the eastern part of the island. There were a few blankets on the rocky bay of onlookers and there was a family of 4 getting ready to snorkel. It was a sight unlike any in California. Well, maybe except for Catalina.</p>

    <p>The ranger accompanied us to the orientation area where we found ranch-architecture, remnants of the sheep and cattle ranches that were on the island from 1869 to 1999. The last sheep was removed in 1999, 3 years after the US government, for the National Park Services (NPS), acquired 25% of the island from the Gherini family.

    <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/california/stories-in-california/santa-cruz-island-anniversary/">The Nature Conservancy</a> purchased the remaining 75% in 1978 and eliminated the remaining cattle industry.</p>
    <p>In 2005, both the Nature Conservancy and NPS embarked on a controversial action to eradicate feral pigs. The NPS already had its share of protesters 4 years prior it eradicated black rats from Anacapa Island. The black rats were believed to have arrived on the island as stowaways on ships before 1940. The rats proved to be an invasive species that did not only threaten birds but also preyed on Anacapa's deer mouse population. The process the eradication included air drop of poisonous green pellets. This moved sparked protests from animal rights activists and debate on the very notion of "native" species.</p>
    <p>Feral pigs on Santa Cruz Island were even more "native" than the rats--as early as 1850s. Starting with less than 100 pigs, the population grew to about <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-jul-28-me-bones28-story.html">LA Times</a> 4,000 in 2005, threatening the lives native species and precious Chumash archaeological sites. "After 150 years, officials claim, there is an urgent need to eradicate pigs, because they are said to trample island vegetation and dig up Chumash Indian grave sites." (<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/green/article/Pig-eradication-plan-out-of-control-2668922.php">SFGATE</a>). The means to this end was to hunt/shoot the pigs. The entire operation took 2 years.</p>
    <p>As a result of these measures, visitors and scientists now have the privilege of being in the midst on a ecology, in essence, untouched by humans--as if humans were never there.</p>

    <h2>Island Fox</h2>
    <p>Before coming to the island, I vowed to see at least one island fox. These island foxes are found in 6 of the 8 islands (3 in the Channel Islands National Park) Scientifically referred to as <em>urocyon littoralis</em>, variations of the subspecies are endemic in each of the 6 islands. These foxes were descendant of mainland gray foxes, but overtime developed their own unique features due to isolation over a long period of time. One notable of these unique features is their size. Island foxes are miniatures compared to mainland foxes. They grow up to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/nature/island-fox.htm">12-13 inches tall and only weigh 4-5 lbs</a>. These foxes are not found anywhere else in the world.
    <ul>
      <li>Urocyon littoralis littoralis of San Miguel Island</li>
      <li>Urocyon littoralis santarosae of Santa Rosa Island</li>
      <li>Urocyon littoralis santacruzae of Santa Cruz Island</li>
      <li>Urocyon littoralis dickeyi of San Nicolas Island</li>
      <li>Urocyon littoralis catalinae of Santa Catalina Island</li>
      <li>Urocyon littoralis clementae of San Clemente Island</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Upon reaching the ranch area, I didn't have to look far. Other day trippers who were having their lunch on tables next to the ranch house were pointing to the rustling of grass and low-lying foliage. I, among others, looked down and there were 2 foxes.</p>

  <h2>Potato Harbor Overlook</h2>
  <p>Due to time constraints, I was only able to do one hike. There are several hiking trails on Santa Cruz, ranging from easy to hard. I chose an easy trail with an incredible vista at the end. The Potato Harbor Trail is a 5-mile loop with 603 feet elevation (<a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/potato-harbor-trail">All Trails</a>). There were no shady areas. Good thing, I had a hat! On the way to Potato Harbor is another trail leading to Cavern Point Loop.</p>

  <p>There were at least 5 other people on the trail to Potato Harbor so it wasn't too lonely of a hike. When we all finally got there, 3 people were standing on the edge of the cliff, taking in the view. And really, who can blame them when the view is this..</p>
