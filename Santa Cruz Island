## **Santa Cruz Island, California**
---

On the 4th of July 2019, after learning about uninhabited islands off the coast of Ventura, I sailed off to Santa Cruz. Santa Cruz is one of the five islands that comprised the Channel Islands National Park. The other four are Anacapa, Santa Rosa, San Miguel, and Santa Barbara. All of these islands and the other Channel Islands (San Clemente, San Nicolas, and Santa Catalina) were designated as a [biosphere reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands_National_Park) by UNESCO in 1976.

Along with other travelersâ€”some day trippers; some overnighters, I braved the hour boat ride in the choppy Pacific Ocean. We encountered a red buoy sheltering young sea lions and massive ships as they made their journeys on the Separation Zone, aka freeway of the ships. It was particularly interesting to see the Disney Cruise Ship, which towered the Hyundai cargo ship nearby.

Before reaching Santa Cruz, we were greeted by **Anacapa**, the smallest island of the archipelago with a total area of [1.14 square miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands_(California)).

In the horizon was the silhouette of **Santa Cruz**, the biggest island with an area of [96.51 square miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands_(California)).

## History of Occupation

Santa Cruz as well as the other islands that comprised the Channel Islands, were inhabited by the Chumash and Tongva tribes. An even more distant past revealed habitation that goes as far back as [13,000 years ago](https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2018/04/17/six_of_the_oldest_human_remains_found_in_the_us.html). Archaeologist Phil Orr in 1959 discovered ancient human bones, later known as the Arlington Springs Man, on Santa Rosa Island. The date of the remains was particularly interesting in terms of migration in the Americas. At that time, the oldest known was the Anzick Boy, aged [12,700 years](https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2018/04/17/six_of_the_oldest_human_remains_found_in_the_us.html), which proved the north to south land migration through Russia-Alaska land bridge. The Arlington Springs Man, named after the excavation site, would change this course.

>"Arlington Springs Man 'lends support for a theory that the earliest peoples to enter the Western Hemisphere may have migrated along the Pacific coast from Siberia and Alaska using boats.'" -- John R. Johnson, Curator of Anthropology at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History

There is little evidence whether the Arlington Springs Man is the ancestors of the Chumash and Tongva peoples, but the tribes flourished in the islands from as early as [11,000 years ago](https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm) as archaeological site in San Miguel Island suggest. In Santa Cruz along 11 Chumash village sites were excavated.

The Tongva peoples occupied the southern island of Santa Barbara. But unlike the Chumash, the Tongva did not seem to have permanent settlements--perhaps due to drought and more rigid landscape.

Historical habitation drastically changed during of the Spanish conquest of the Americas which included the a big portion of the United States.

Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo landed on San Miguel Island in 1542 on behalf of Spain to convert the natives to Christianity.

Catholic Missions were built on the mainland as well and by early 1800s, the natives of the islands were transported to the mainland, mainly around Santa Barbara and Santa Ynez areas.
